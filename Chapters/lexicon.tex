\entry{kujari}{kuZa\textturnrrtail i}{na}{Southern Cassowary; \textit{(fig)} a
  person prone to listlessness}

\begin{remark}
The Southern Cassowary is seen as untamable and always in control. However, it
seems to have no definite plans and spends its time wandering aimlessly. This
sentiment can be applied to people.
\end{remark}

\entry{wurr}{wu\|]R}{v}{(\textbf{0}) it is electrically storming, there is
  lightning; (1) to be struck by lightning; (2) to strike}
